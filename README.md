1. Get length of numbers to be entered by the user
2. Get input (Arrays of numbers) from user
3. Copy the set of numbers (Array) in to another variable
4. Compare index 0 of first variable to index 1 of the other variable
5. If index 0 of the first variable is lesser, it remains index 0
other wise it is stored/moved to index 1
6. The test goes on like that, until the numbers are sorted
7. Finally print sorted numbers
